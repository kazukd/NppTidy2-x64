# HTML Tidy 2 Plugin for Notepad++ 64bit version 
This plugin provides feature which is tidying HTML code quickly.

Original source is 'HTML Tidy 2 Plugin for Notepad++' from https://github.com/bruderstein/NppTidy2.
That is for 32bit version so we can not use it on the Notepad++ latest version.

Also this plugin uses tidy-html5 from http://github.com/w3c/tidy-html5.
Thank you for sharing excelent code.

I've just convert from 32bit version to 64bit version.
The features of the plugin is same as 32bit version.

## Installation
Meke the new folder which name is 'Tidy2' under your Notepad++\plugins folder.
Just copy the Tidy2.dll to the new folder and doc folder.

For example, my environment is blow file tree.
```
C:\Program Files\Notepad++\plugins\Tidy2
│   LICENSE
│   Tidy2.dll
└───doc
    │   quickref.html
    │   tidy.css
```
## Run
After copying, run Notepad++.
It can be seen 'Tidy2-x64' in Plugins menu of Notepad++.

If Notepad++ is running duaring it is copying, it requires restarting Notepad++.

## How to use

your Notepad++\plugins directory. Ideally add the doc folder to Notepad++\plugins directory too, this will mean you have the correct documentation, and the "Show Config Help" option will show the documentation that applies to your version (rather than simply the latest on the web)
